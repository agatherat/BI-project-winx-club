## How to run
1. Ensure the configuration is complete, then open **PS** command line and execute command:

```
2. Access the services in your browser:

## Setup and Configuration Tips

### Create self-signed SSL certificate _(for Windows)_
_**Prerequisites:** WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)_

1. Run the following command in **WSL** to create a self-signed SSL certificate (`localhost.crt`) and private key (`localhost.key`):
```shell
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost'
```
2. Move SSL certificate and private key files to project tree in `./certs/`
3. To ensure your browser trusts the self-signed certificate, import it into the Windows certificate store using **PowerShell**:
```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath 'path\to\cert\localhost.crt' -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root\
```
