## Project description
The project for the subject "E-Business 2024/2025," consists of two stages in which students are tasked with creating an online store based on PrestaShop software.
Our team created a website for an online store named [Magic Cafe](https://magiccafe.eu/)

## Dependencies 
- [PrestaShop 1.7.8](https://pl.prestashop.com/)
- [Selenium 4.2.7](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2024/selenium-4-27-released/)
  
## Prerequisites
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/agatherat/BI-project-winx-club.git`
3. [Create self-signed SSL certificate](#create-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-windows)

## How to run
1. Ensure the configuration is complete, then open the command line (in the project tree) and execute the following command:
```powershell
  docker-compose up
```
2. Access the services in your browser.
  Once the environment is up and running, you can open the following URLs in your browser:
  - https://localhost - online store
  - https://localhost/admin4577 - store Administration Panel
  - https://localhost:8081 - phpMyAdmin interface

## Setup and Configuration Tips



### Create self-signed SSL certificate _(for Windows)_
_**Prerequisites:** WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)_

1. Run the following command in **WSL** to create a self-signed SSL certificate (`localhost.crt`) and private key (`localhost.key`):
```shell
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost'
```
2. Move SSL certificate and private key files to project tree in `./certs/`
3. To ensure your browser trusts the self-signed certificate, import it into the Windows certificate store using **PowerShell**:
```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath 'path\to\cert\localhost.crt' -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root\
```
